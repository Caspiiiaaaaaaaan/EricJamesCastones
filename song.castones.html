    <h1>"Hate Me"</h1>

    <h2>Ellie Goulding & Juice WRLD</h2>

    <h4>[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]</h4>
    <p>Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me <br>
    Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me <br>
    Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me <br>
    Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me <br></p>
    
    <h4>[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]</h4>
    <p>I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed <br>
    I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope <br>
    Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho <br>
    You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know <br></p>
    
    <h4>[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]</h4>
    <p>It's a thin line between all this love and hate <br>
    And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place <br>
    So baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate <br>
    Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate <br></p>
    
    <h4>[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]</h4>
    <p>And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me <br>
    Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me <br>
    Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me <br>
    Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me <br>
    Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me <br>
    Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me <br>
    Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me <br>
    Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me <br></p>
    
    <h4>[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]</h4>
    <p>Hate me, hate me, tell me how you hate me <br>
    Tell me how I'm trash and you could easily replace me <br>
    Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily <br>
    Prolly 'cause there's no one around me numbin' all my pain <br>
    Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain <br>
    Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games <br>
    You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games <br>
    They give me migraines and damage my brain <br>
    Date me, break me, easily replace me <br>
    Hopefully you see it clear, hopefully it's HD <br>
    Bet you wonder why the last few months I've been spacey <br>
    In your head, I sing... <br></p>
    
    <h4>[Chorus: Ellie Goulding with Juice WRLD]</h4>
    <p>And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me <br>
    Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me <br>
    Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me <br>
    Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me <br>
    Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me<br>
    Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me<br>
    Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me<br>
    Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me<br></p>
    
    <h4>[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]</h4>
    <p>It's a thin line between all this love and hate (Okay)<br>
    And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place (Okay)<br>
    So baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate (Okay)<br>
    Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate (Okay)<br></p>
